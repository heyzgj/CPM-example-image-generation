# T015 - Critical Bug Fixes: Hydration, Infinite Loops & Alignment

## Overview
Fix critical runtime errors preventing proper application functionality including hydration mismatches, infinite render loops, and content alignment issues.

## Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. **Hydration Error Fix** ✅
**Problem**: Server/client rendering mismatch causing hydration failures
```
Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server
```

**Solution**: 
- Added `mounted` state to Navigation component
- Implemented client-side rendering guards
- Ensured consistent server/client DOM structure
- Prevented dynamic content rendering before hydration

### 2. **Infinite Render Loop Fix** ✅
**Problem**: ProjectGrid component causing maximum update depth exceeded
```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect
```

**Solution**:
- Stabilized React hook dependencies
- Removed performance monitoring causing re-renders
- Fixed useEffect dependency arrays
- Added proper component mounting checks
- Implemented stable refs to prevent dependency issues

### 3. **Content Alignment Fix** ✅
**Problem**: Content not properly centered and aligned across pages

**Solution**:
- Fixed page container structure in upload page
- Added proper background gradient
- Ensured consistent max-width containers
- Maintained responsive design integrity

## Technical Implementation

### Navigation Component Fixes
```typescript
// Added mounted state to prevent hydration issues
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);

// Render static content until mounted
if (!mounted) {
  return (/* Static JSX without dynamic content */);
}
```

### ProjectGrid Component Fixes
```typescript
// Stabilized dependencies and refs
const projectStorage = useRef(getProjectStorage());
const filterRef = useRef<ProjectFilter>({});

// Fixed useEffect dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  if (!mounted) return;
  
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    loadProjects(true);
  }, 100);
  
  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [mounted, loadProjects, searchQuery, styleFilter, favoritesOnly]);
```

### Layout Container Fixes
```typescript
// Improved page container structure
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 via-white to-orange-50 py-6">
  <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Results Achieved
