# T013 - History Page Empty State & Loading Fixes

## Overview
Fix the history page to properly handle empty states when no images have been generated, replacing the endless refreshing with a proper empty state display.

## Current Issues
- Page shows loading spinner indefinitely when no projects exist
- No clear indication that user hasn't generated any images yet
- Missing proper empty state messaging and call-to-action

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Proper Empty State Display**
   - Show clear message when no projects exist
   - Include helpful call-to-action to create first project
   - Attractive empty state illustration or icon

2. **Loading State Improvements**
   - Finite loading time with proper timeout
   - Clear error handling for storage issues
   - Skeleton loading that resolves to empty state if needed

3. **User Guidance**
   - Encourage users to upload their first image
   - Link to upload page from empty state
   - Show storage capacity information even when empty

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Efficient empty state detection
   - Proper component lifecycle management

## Technical Requirements
- Fix loading state logic in ProjectGrid component
- Implement proper empty state detection
- Add timeout for loading states
- Maintain performance optimizations
