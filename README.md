# 🎨 AI Image Style Transfer - Built with ✨ Zero Code

> **This app was built end-to-end by [Cursor Project Master](https://github.com/heyzgj/cursor-project-master)—no code manually written.**

Transform any image into an artwork using **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**, all in under 5 seconds. This project showcases how **writing only docs** (PRD, Tech Spec, UX) can generate a **production-grade app**—including code, tests, CI/CD, and deployment.

## 💡 Built by Docs

* `PRD.md` → feature spec
* `TECH_SPEC.md` → architecture
* `UX_FLOW.md` → user interaction
* `STYLE_GUIDE.md` → UI system

Then run CPM. That’s it. No boilerplate, no debugging, no deployment setup.
