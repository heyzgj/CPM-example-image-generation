# Technical Specification

## 1. Overview
*[Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture and design approach. Summarize how the main components will interact to fulfill the PRD.]*

## 2. Architecture Diagram
*[*(Optional)* Include a diagram or describe the architecture in terms of clients, servers, services, databases, etc., and how data flows between them.]*

## 3. Components
*[Break down the system into components/modules. For each component, describe its responsibility and how it interacts with others.]*

- **Frontend:** *[e.g., React web app for user interface – handles authentication, profile management, etc.]*  
- **Backend:** *[e.g., Node.js API server – provides REST endpoints for ...]*  
- **Database:** *[e.g., PostgreSQL – stores user data, with schema described in Data Map]*  
- **External Services:** *[e.g., Payment gateway API, etc., if any]*  

## 4. Data Models
*[Describe key data structures and models. Reference the DATA_MAP if detailed schemas are in that document. Mention important fields and relationships.]*

- **User Model:** *[fields: id, name, email, password_hash, created_at]*  
- **Order Model:** *[fields: id, user_id (FK), items, total_price, created_at]*  
- *...*

## 5. API Design
*[Outline the main API endpoints or interfaces. For each, specify the request/response format. If internal modules interact via interfaces, document those as well.]*

- **POST /api/signup:** *Creates a new user (params: name, email, password).*  
- **GET /api/profile:** *Returns current user profile data.*  
- *...*

## 6. Key Technical Decisions
*[List important decisions and justifications: e.g., choice of framework or libraries, use of microservice vs monolith, any caching strategy, etc. Explain why these choices were made (to guide the AI in following them).]*

- **Language & Framework:** *[e.g., Node.js with Express for backend – chosen due to team expertise and async IO needs]*  
- **Auth Method:** *[JWT for stateless auth tokens]*  
- **State Management:** *[Using Redux on frontend for...]*  
- *...*

## 7. Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
*[Document performance targets, security requirements, scalability considerations, etc. These guide the AI in writing code that meets these constraints.]*

- *Must handle up to **1000 concurrent users** (per new requirement in PRD). This influences database and load balancing design.*  
- *All personal data must be encrypted at rest (security compliance).*  
- *...*

## 8. Migration and Deployment Plan
*[If applicable, note how the system will be deployed or how data migrations will run. E.g., "Use Docker for containerization", "CI/CD pipeline for automated testing/deployment".]*
