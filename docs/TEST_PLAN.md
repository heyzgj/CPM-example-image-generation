# Test Plan

## 1. Testing Strategy
*[Overview of the testing approach: unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests? Which frameworks or tools will be used (e.g., Jest for unit tests, Cypress for e2e, etc.)? How will tests be organized (by feature, by layer)?]*

- **Unit Tests:** *[e.g., for individual functions and components.]*  
- **Integration Tests:** *[e.g., for API endpoints with database, or UI with backend via a testing environment.]*  
- **End-to-End Tests:** *[e.g., using a headless browser to simulate user interactions through the UI]*  
- **Performance Tests:** *[if applicable]*  
- **Security Tests:** *[if applicable]*  

## 2. Test Environment
*[Describe the setup for running tests: any test databases, environment variables, CI/CD integration for tests.]*

## 3. Test Cases by Feature
*[For each feature (from the PRD), list the key test cases. Each test case should have a brief description. Optionally, include expected outcome or acceptance criteria.]*

**Feature A:** (from PRD)  
- Test A1: *[Description of test scenario]* â€“ *Expected:* [what should happen]  
- Test A2: *[...] - Expected: ...*  
- *...*

**Feature B:**  
- Test B1: *[...] - Expected: ...*  
- *...*

*(Continue for all major features.)*

## 4. Non-Functional Tests
*[List tests for requirements like performance, security, etc., if they exist. E.g., "Load test: 1000 concurrent logins within 5 seconds - system should handle without error."]*

## 5. Test Data
*[Describe any special test data or fixtures needed. E.g., "Dummy user accounts will be created for testing login," or "Sample dataset X is used for testing the recommendation algorithm."*]
